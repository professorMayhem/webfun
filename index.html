		<h1> Melissa Holmes </h1>
		
		<h2> My Work </h2>
		
			<p> I have been teaching computing topics full-time for about 12 years.  I worked in IT for about 19 years before that.  My primary areas of interest are user experience, instructional design, web development, programming languages and database systems.</p>
			
		<h2> My Pets </h2>
			
			<p> I have way too many critters. </p>
			
		<h2> Hobbies </h2>
		
			<p> I love anything that has to do with art and the great outdoors!  I am a member of a local pottery studio and I attend as many local art events as I can.  I also spend a lot of time in the mountains, by the river, or on the beach. </p>
